# BeachWorm Web App
Music web application designed to recommend music to users that becomes tailored over time, created as part of the Senior Project capstone project of the Rowan University B.S. in Computer Science degree. Through authorization through a Spotify Premium account, the user gains access native playback that persists across the site, as well as features such as a full playlist creation and editing component and a limited friends system. Guest session functionality provides limited support of these features, prompting the user to log-in and authorize for the full feature set.
